# UT99-OpenAL
Guide how to enable 3D spatial audio for Unreal Tournament 1999.

Intended to be used with **headphones** (stereo).  

All audio enhancements need to be turned off i.e. Windows Sonic, Creative stuff, Razer 7.1 Surround Sound...  
The difference should be clearly noticeable as sound becomes out-of-head.

Non-native to game "solutions" to create 3D spatial audio for headphones is done using only 5.1/7.1 channel output.  
Having 3D spatial sound directly from audio engine is more accurate.

Instructions and a way to find best sounding HRTF are included in 'Readme.txt' inside release archive.
