# UT99-OpenAL
Guide how to enable 3D spatial audio for Unreal Tournament 1999 aka UT99.

Intended to be used with **headphones** (stereo). Works with any sound card.  
The difference should be clearly noticeable as sound becomes out-of-head.

Non-native to game "solutions" to create 3D spatial audio for headphones is done using only 5.1/7.1 channel output.  
Having 3D spatial sound directly from audio engine is more accurate.  
Patched UT99 supports OpenAL Soft which allows to enable 3D spatial audio with custom HRTF.

Instructions and a way to find best sounding HRTF are included in 'Readme.txt' inside release archive.
